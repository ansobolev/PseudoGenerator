# PseudoGenerator

The generator of `good pseudopotentials for SIESTA code. To make it work, several things have to be taken care of:

 1. `atom` program (from `Pseudo` directory in SIESTA) has to be present in the system 
 2. `settings.py` file. It can be taken from `settings` folder and renamed accordingly; 
or it can be written from scratch using any file from this folder as an example.
 3.  files from **[DeltaCodesDFT]** project, put in the `delta` folder in `pseudogen`.
